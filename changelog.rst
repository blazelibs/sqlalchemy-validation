0.2.0 released 2012-10-24
=========================

This release contains some **BC BREAKS**.

* internal API cleaned up
* refactored to use SQLAlchemy (SA) events, we are now compatable with & require
  SA >= 0.7
* CHANGE: if using SA < 0.7.6, savalidation.watch_session() must be called with each
  instance of your session IF the savalidation module is being instantiated
  before your session is created.
* CHANGE: the validator API has changed.  If you have created custom validators
  you will need to look at the changes in validators.py.
* the Formencode state object sent to a validator's method has changed the
  "instance" attribute to be "entity."
* add before_flush() helper to decorate entity instance methods
* got rid of after_flush validation.  Instead, before_insert/before_update events
    can now be used to validate non-nullable foreign keys.
* got rid of validation support for a column's default and server_default
    values (b/c it required after_flush validation)
* formencode schemas are now only created once per class, not per instance,
    boosting performance.
