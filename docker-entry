# This script is ran by the docker image.  It does any necessary setup and should then kick-off
# whatever tests you want ran by CI, presumably by using tox.  However, you can customize as
# needed.
#
# Image Modification Notice: if you find yourself needing to modify the OS in any way, e.g.
# `apt-get install ...`, this probably isn't the place to do that.  It would be better to get
# the docker image that you are using for testing updated to have your modifications.
# While you can technically do it here and it will probably work, it's much slower to have to do
# that modification every time the tests run than to rebuild the docker image with the changes
# needed.

# just some debugging info

# Install tox from the wheelhouse using our target python version.
# You could skip this step and use the tox installed in the docker image.  I (RS) like this option
# b/c it gives me control over what version of tox I'm using without having to rebuild the
# docker image.
